# May The Best Portfolio Win

## Challenge

A client investment firm has been investing in algorithmic trading strategies. Some of the investment managers love them, some hate them, but they all think their way is best. Apply quantitative analysis techniques using Python and Pandas so the client can identify which portfolio (Hedge Fund, Whale, Algos) is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

## Deliverables

* A tool that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas; determine which portfolio outperformed the others.
* Data Visualization: Historical daily returns of several portfolios used included algorithmic portfolios, portfolios of famous "whale" investors, and a portfolio based on big hedge and mutual funds. 
* A custom portfolio of stocks to compare its performance to the other portfolios, as well as the larger market of the S&P 500.
