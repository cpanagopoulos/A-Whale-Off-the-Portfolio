# A Whale Off the Port(folio)

## Background

A client investment firm has been investing in algorithmic trading strategies. Some of the investment managers love them, some hate them, but they all think their way is best.

## Challenge 

Apply quantitative analysis techniques using Python and Pandas so the client can identify which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

## Tasks Completed

* Create a tool that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas.
* Determine which portfolio outperformed the others.
* Historical daily returns of several portfolios  used included algorithmic portfolios, portfolios of famous "whale" investors, and a portfolio based on big hedge and mutual funds. 
* Created custom portfolio of stocks to compare its performance to the other portfolios, as well as the larger market of the S&P 500.
